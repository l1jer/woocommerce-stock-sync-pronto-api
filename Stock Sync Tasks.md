# Project Review and Enhancement Implementation

## Objective:
Review, understand, and analyse the existing project, then implement the following changes while adhering to the project's standards and best practices. Please do not do anything outside of tasks. Adding logs wherever needed. 

### Tasks:
- [x] **1.1.8** The dynamic batch calculation must account for all product types, including variable products. Currently, several products' stock is not being synchronised, which may be due to this oversight. 

- [x] **1.2** Create a new page titled "Stock Sync Status" under the Products tab, with the slug set to `wc-sspaa-settings`. This page should include the following functionalities:
   - [x] **1.2.1** Display the current UTC time alongside the current AEST time, accounting for both daylight saving and non-daylight saving periods, also indicating if it is daylight saving or non-daylight saving period.
   - [x] **1.2.2** Implement an option to update the start time for the daily stock synchronisation (in Sydney time) with a Save Time button (formatted as hh:mm:ss), while also displaying the corresponding UTC date and time in a read-only format next to it.
   - [x] **1.2.3** Show the total number of products that have SKUs.
   - [x] **1.2.4** Indicate the total number of batches involved in a complete stock synchronisation cycle.
   - [x] **1.2.5** Display the date and time of the next scheduled batch in both UTC and Sydney time.
   - [x] **1.2.6** Present the last synchronisation completion date and time in both UTC and Sydney time.
   - [x] **1.2.7** Remove additional logs.

- [x] **1.3** Make the project dynamic by automatically using the correct set of API credentials from the `config.php` file based on the website context. There are 3 sets of username and password based on different websites(see below API credentials) using a same API URL
   - [x] **1.3.1** Add a dropdown menu in the **Stock Sync Status** page that lists all available API usernames and passwords (display their website URL instead of showing the credentials in the dropdown list). This selection should update dynamically via AJAX without clicking any save button.
   - [x] **1.3.2** Add a **Test API Connection** button next to the dropdown. When clicked, it should test the currently selected credentials and display either **SUCCESS** or **FAIL** based on the response.
   - [x] **1.3.3** The `config.php` contains 3 different sets of usernames and passwords for API access. Depending on the website being used, load and apply the appropriate credentials. Additionally, display the currently active credentials (both name and value) on the **wc-sspaa-setting** page for reference.
   - [x] **1.3.4** Review the implementation of the Daily Sync Start Time feature.
         [x] Confirm which timezone is currently being used â€” it appears to be set to UTC.
         [x] Update the logic to ensure the Daily Sync Start Time uses the Sydney timezone (AEST) instead of UTC.
         [x] Test to verify the correct sync time runs based on Sydney (AEST) timezone.
   - [x] **1.3.5** Review, identify and understand these following logs then fix them in best practices:
                  [15-Apr-2025 12:00:04 UTC] PHP Warning:  Undefined array key "HTTP_HOST" in /home/customer/www/zerotech.com.au/public_html/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-stock-sync-pronto-api/includes/config.php on line 27
                  [15-Apr-2025 12:00:04 UTC] PHP Deprecated:  str_replace(): Passing null to parameter #3 ($subject) of type array|string is deprecated in /home/customer/www/zerotech.com.au/public_html/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-stock-sync-pronto-api/includes/config.php on line 27
   - [x] **1.3.6** The sync time has been updated to 22:00 AEST; however, I observed the following logs at 22:00 and 22:30 (AEST), yet no products have been updated on the All Products page. This indicates a potential issue with this essential feature. Please investigate and resolve this:
                  [2025-04-15 12:00:14] Processing batch with offset: 0
                  [2025-04-15 12:30:07] Processing batch with offset: 15
   - [x] **1.3.7** Investigate and resolve the issue where a significant number of products are not being synchronised during the daily scheduled stock sync on certain sites (e.g., nitecoreaustralia.com.au, which has 190 products). The debug log indicates that not all products are processed in the scheduled batches, whereas other sites (such as zerotech.com.au with 168 products) do not exhibit this problem. Analyse the batch processing logic, identify any discrepancies or missed products, and implement a robust solution to ensure all products (including all product types and variations) are reliably included and synchronised in every scheduled sync cycle.
   See below log from nitecoreaustralia.com.au website:

   - [x] **1.3.8** Implement a mechanism so that the plugin's debug.log file only retains log entries from the last 4 days. Older log entries (older than 4 days from the current date/time) should be automatically deleted or purged on a regular basis, ensuring the log file remains current and does not grow indefinitely.
   - [x] **1.3.9** Examine and address the problem where deactivating and reactivating the plugin fails to fully remove all scheduled actions (cron jobs) associated with stock sync batches. On plugin deactivation, guarantee that every scheduled batch event is thoroughly and reliably cleared, preventing any leftover or duplicate scheduled actions when the plugin is reactivated. Ensure comprehensive debug logging is in place to verify the removal of all scheduled events, and upon reactivation, confirm that only the correct, newly scheduled batch events exist. Review the current deactivation logic, pinpoint any deficiencies, and apply a best-practice approach to ensure a pristine state for scheduled actions during every deactivate/reactivate cycle.

      ----------------------------------------
      As seen in the debug log: "Processing batch with offset:" entries progress sequentially for offsets 0 through 120, then jump to 165, 135, and 150, after which no further batches are processed. Even though the total product count is 190, some products are not synchronised.
   - [x] **1.3.10** Investigate and resolve the API rate limiting issue (HTTP 429 errors) observed during stock synchronisation. The provided logs show multiple API requests being made within a short timeframe (often within the same second), exceeding the external API's rate limit (indicated as 1 request per 2 seconds in the error response). Analyse the code responsible for making API calls during the sync process and implement a robust solution, such as introducing appropriate delays or rate limiting, to ensure API requests comply with the external service's rate limits. Apply best practices for handling external API interactions and add necessary debug logging to confirm the rate limit is being respected and errors are no longer occurring.

   - [ ] **1.3.11** Implement and configure the API call delay for stock synchronisation. Set the delay between API requests to 3 seconds (3,000,000 microseconds). Verify that this delay is correctly applied and effective in preventing rate limit errors for both the scheduled cron sync and the manual â€œSync Product" button.

      **Action awaiting decision:**  
      Perform a comprehensive review of the batch scheduling and processing logic. Determine the underlying cause for missing or unscheduled batches, which leads to unsynchronised products. Ensure the batch system consistently includes all products (covering every type and variation) in each sync cycle, regardless of the total product count. Strengthen logging and validation to verify that every product is scheduled and processed in the sync. Deliver a detailed analysis of the issue and implement or recommend a solution that guarantees all products are synchronised in every future cycle.
      - [ ] **1.4.0** Implement a "Sync All Products Now" button on the All Products admin page, matching the look as the admin page. When clicked, this button should:
        - Trigger a manual AJAX action to synchronise the stock of all products immediately, bypassing any scheduled cron jobs.
        - For each product, sync its stock based on SKU, introducing a 3-second delay between each sync to respect API rate limits.
        - Add comprehensive debug logging for the sync process, including details of each product's sync attempt, success/failure, and any API responses, all written to the plugin's debug.log file.
